NAME
    RDF::QueryX::Lazy - yeah, all those PREFIX definitions get boring

SYNOPSIS
     my $query = RDF::QueryX::Lazy->new(<<SPARQL);
     SELECT *
     WHERE {
       ?person foaf:name ?name .
       OPTIONAL { ?person foaf:homepage ?page . }
     }
     SPARQL

DESCRIPTION
    This is a fairly trivial subclass of RDF::Query that auto-defines many
    prefixes for you, so you can be lazy. It should have most of the common
    ones in there.

    Oh yeah, and if you want, you can pass a key 'lazy' in the RDF::Query
    %options hash with additional prefix mappings.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to
